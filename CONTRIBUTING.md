## Contributing

Hey! Thanks for digging deep into the repo :)

This template is built on [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org). The folder structure mostly follows a Nuxt.js project.

The website itself builds automatically on push using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and `nuxt generate`. You can take a look at this script in [`.github/workflows/proddeploy.yml`](https://github.com/Cobertos/GWU-website-template/blob/master/.github/workflows/proddeploy.yml) to configure it as you desire. GitHub Actions is currently in beta but that shouldn't stop your repository from being able to clone and use actions.
